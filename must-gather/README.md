LVM must-gather
=================

`lvm-must-gather` is a tool built on top of [OpenShift must-gather](https://github.com/openshift/must-gather)
that expands its capabilities to gather LVM Operator information.

### Usage
```sh
oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/lvms_dev/lvms-must-gather:latest
```

The command above will create a local directory with a dump of the lvm state.

You will get a dump of:
- The LVM Operator namespaces (and its children objects)
- All namespaces (and their children objects) that belong to any LVM resources
- All LVM CRD's definitions
